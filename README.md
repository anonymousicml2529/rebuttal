## Figure 1. Additional Baselines for Parameter Generation (AmbientGAN for s, and M-SBL)

a) Eight exemplary training samples, b) power angular profile and a histogram of the angular spread from 10000 generated samples by CP-VAE, CP-GMM, AmbientGAN with a generator outputting s and M-SBL, compared to ground truth, c)squared absolute value of four exemplary generated samples of CP-VAE, CP-GMM, AmbientGAN with a generator outputting s and M-SBL, respectively.

## Figure 3. Experiments regarding the Grid Resolution in OFDM simulations

a) and b) nMSE and cosine similarity for reconstructing ground-truth channels by an autoencoder trained on channel realizations produced by the generative models, respectively. We choose the maximally resolvable delay to be 8Î¼s and the maximally resolvable doppler shift to be 100Hz, but vary the grid resolution S, i.e., the delay-doppler grid exhibits S^2 gridpoints. In c), exemplary drawn samples are shown for the different grid resolutions.

## Figure 5. Experiments regarding the Measurement Campaign Data

a) Power angular profile of newly generated samples by the CP-VAE when it is trained on the full dataset from the measurement
campaign. b) Histogram of the angular spread when the CP-VAE is solely trained on LoS channels in the measurement campaign, and
solely trained on NLoS channels in the measurement campaign. c) Exemplary samples drawn from the CP-VAEs trained on solely LoS
and NLoS channels.
