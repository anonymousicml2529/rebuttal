## Figure 1. Additional Baselines for Parameter Generation (AmbientGAN for s, and M-SBL)

a) Eight exemplary training samples, b) power angular profile and a histogram of the angular spread from 10000 generated samples by CP-VAE, CP-GMM, AmbientGAN with a generator outputting s and M-SBL, compared to ground truth, c)squared absolute value of four exemplary generated samples of CP-VAE, CP-GMM, AmbientGAN with a generator outputting s and M-SBL, respectively.

## Figure 2. Experiments regarding number K of CP-GMM components

Dependency of the angular spread on the number K of components of the CP-GMM.

## Figure 3. Experiments the Grid Resolution in OFDM simulations

a) and b) nMSE and cosine similarity for reconstructing ground-truth channels by an autoencoder trained on channel realizations produced by the generative models, respectively. We choose the maximally resolvable delay to be 8Î¼s and the maximally resolvable doppler shift to be 100Hz, but vary the grid resolution S, i.e., the delay-doppler grid exhibits S^2 gridpoints. In c), exemplary drawn samples are shown for the different grid resolutions.
